	<h2 class="centerText">Bio:</h2>
	<p class="centerText">I am a student at Boise State University. I aspire to be the creative director for a successful video game one day. I have been very interested in television and video games for most of my life and have always found fictional worlds to be more interesting than the real world. I want to create games and entertainment that people can use to escape from their everyday problems and feel a sense of excitement and wonder.</p>
